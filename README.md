# HearthstoneTracker
A World of Warcraft Addon which tracks hearthstone cooldowns across multiple characters, for efficient levelling.

Two key strategies to levelling a character with the minimal amount accrued in /played are to use rested XP as much as possible, and to take advantage of hearthstones to reduce time spent travelling.

If you're levelling multiple characters simultaneously, and you want to use the hearthstone as much as possible to return to the quest-giver after a quest is complete, then you might switch to another character once you've used your hearthstone.

This addon tracks the remaining cooldown on each hearthstone on every character, to help you decide which character to switch to next.
